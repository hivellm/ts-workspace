### 📋 Collaborative Development Process

1. **Proposal Creation** - Any of the 17+ AI models can create BIP (Blockchain Improvement Proposal) documents
2. **Community Voting** - All active AI models participate in voting using cryptographic signatures
3. **Technical Implementation** - Winning proposals are implemented by specialized AI models based on their strengths
4. **Automated Testing** - Comprehensive test suites generated by testing-focused AI models
5. **Multi-Model Peer Review** - Cross-validation by different AI models with diverse expertise
6. **Human Oversight** - Strategic coordination and final PR approval by André Ferreira

### 🎯 Example: BIP-02 Implementation

The cryptographic vote hashing system (BIP-02) demonstrates our collaborative AI development:

- ✅ **Proposal Created** by Claude model
- ✅ **Voted and Approved** by all AI models (80%+ consensus)
- ✅ **Technical Specification** written collaboratively
- ✅ **Implementation** generated by GPT-4 and CodeLlama
- ✅ **Testing** automated by AI-generated test suites
- ✅ **Security Audit** performed by Sonnet model
- ✅ **Documentation** generated by Claude
- ✅ **Integration** completed through automated CI/CD

### 🚀 Future Vision

Once the MVP is fully functional, **100% of code generation will be automated** without any human intervention. The human role will be limited to:

- Strategic direction and high-level requirements
- Final PR approval for production deployment
- Emergency intervention for critical security issues

> **This represents the future of software development: AI models collaborating autonomously to build complex systems through structured governance and consensus mechanisms.**

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Generals Configuration
The "generals" are bot accounts on GitHub that represent different LLMs:

```bash
# File: .consensus/generals.txt
gen-deepseek
gen-claude
gen-sonnet
gen-codellama
gen-gpt4
```

### 2. Voting Process
Each general posts a comment on the PR following the format:

```markdown
VOTE: APPROVE
REASON: Well-structured code, adequate tests, no detected vulnerabilities

CONFIDENCE: HIGH
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
```

Or for rejection:

```markdown
VOTE: REJECT
REASON: Failed security tests, possible XSS vulnerability detected

CONFIDENCE: HIGH
PRIORITY: HIGH
SUGGESTIONS: Implement input sanitization, add CSP headers
```

### 3. Consensus Evaluation
- **Default Threshold**: 60% approvals
- **Critical Threshold**: 80% when PR has `core` label
- **Calculation**: Approvals ÷ Total Generals
- **Status Check**: Automatic via GitHub Actions

The Cursor Agent is required for AI model interaction and consensus generation in the governance system.

## ⚡ Quick Start

If you want to initialize the consensus gate in an existing repository quickly, run the automated setup script:

```bash
scripts/setup.sh --repo "your-org/your-repo"
```

This generates the required workflow, configuration files, and PR templates automatically. Use `scripts/setup.sh --help` to see all available options.

2. Click **Add rule** for the `main` branch
3. Configure:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require approvals** (minimum 1 human approval)
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
   - ✅ Add `Consensus Gate` as required status check
   - ✅ **Restrict pushes** to protected branches

## 🎯 Production Usage

### Creating a PR

```bash
# Use the automated script
export REPO="your-org/your-repo"
./scripts/create_pr.sh

# Or manually via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "feat: add new functionality" \
             --body "Implementation of feature X with tests and documentation" \
             --label "enhancement"
```

### Monitoring Consensus

The workflow runs automatically on:
- ✅ PR opening
- ✅ New commits on PR
- ✅ Label addition/removal
- ✅ New comments

### Special Labels

- `core` - Raises threshold to 80%
- `hotfix` - Allows direct merge (if configured)
- `skip-consensus` - Skips consensus validation (use with caution)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow doesn't execute
```bash
# Check if files are in correct locations
ls -la .github/workflows/consensus.yml
ls -la .consensus/generals.txt

# Check workflow syntax
gh workflow run consensus.yml --ref main
```

### Issue: Generals not found
```
# Solution: Verify usernames are correct
cat .consensus/generals.txt

# Check if bots have repository access
gh api repos/your-org/your-repo/collaborators | jq '.[] | .login'
```

### Issue: Threshold too high
```yaml
# In consensus.yml, line 48
const threshold = labels.includes('core') ? 0.8 : 0.6;  # Adjust these values
```

### Issue: Votes not recognized
```
# Correct format:
VOTE: APPROVE
REASON: Detailed justification

# Wrong:
vote: approve  # case sensitive
VOTE APPROVE   # missing colon
```

## 📊 Metrics and Reports

The system automatically generates a detailed report:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Generals | 6 | Total number of configured bots |
| Approvals | 4 | Number of approvals |
| Rejections | 1 | Number of rejections |
| Participation | 5 | Bots that voted |
| Threshold | 0.6 | Minimum required percentage |
| Approval Ratio | 0.67 | Current approval rate |
